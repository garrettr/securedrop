    <b>Your code name is:</b><br />

    If you would like to pick a differnt code name, please <a id='regenerate-link'>regenerate</a>.

    You will need this code name to access any responses to your submission. Please memorize it or save it in a secure place if you want to be able to get responses. (However, this code name of course will help identify you as the submitter &mdash; so don't keep it anywhere it might get discovered.)
